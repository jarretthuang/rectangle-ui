### A code-first UI component library for Angular.

With the recent advancements in Angular, such as [signals](https://angular.dev/guide/signals) and [standalone components](https://angular.dev/guide/components/importing), itâ€™s now feasible to create a code-first UI component library tailored for Angular.

Inspired by popular libraries like [shadcn-ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) for React, my goal is to develop a suite of Angular UI components that can be effortlessly copied and pasted into any Angular project, with minimal setup or configuration.

### Dependencies
- `@angular/core`
- `@angular/common`
- `@ng-icons`
- `tailwindcss`
